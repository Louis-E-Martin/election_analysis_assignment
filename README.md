## Election Summary
This script that we wrote for this election could with just some small modifcations for the election be used for any type of election. For example if we wanted to use this code for larger elections that could be nation wide and you wanted it to be broken down by state you could simply modify the varibles that look at the county to make it by state. Additionally you caould just copy what is used for the county level and add it in to also get the state if you wanted both and had the data. This could also be used for more local elections inside a county if you wanted to break vote up by the town they came from you could once again with very little modifcation have the code display towns instead of countys.
